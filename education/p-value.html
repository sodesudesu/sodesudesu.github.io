In today's Mathematics B curriculum, students are required to study statictics.
Unfortunately for university entrance examinations, lectures focus on practical techniques alone.
They (not only students but also teachers) hardly contemplate the essence of statistics taking time.
</p>

<p>
In response to this tragic situation, I would like to introduce one essential method to $p$-value, hypothesis testing and confidence interval with a simple example.
</p>

<p>
This must be common knowledge among all students and teachers.
Therefore I avoided calling it a "new" interpretation, I hope it should be a "Standard" interpretation.
